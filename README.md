# Employee Tracker
This assignment was created collaboratively with Zach Duty, Jeremy Joanet, and Matt Reisdorf. Some additional assistance was provided by Tom Siemon. 

Employee Tracker utilizes JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js to create a command-line application for viewing, updating, adding, and deleting employees (as well as departments and managers) within an organization. Additionally, Inquirer.js, Console.Table, and Dotenv are used to create user prompts and display results in an easy to read format.
